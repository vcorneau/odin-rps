Rock paper scissors program for The Odin Project foundations course.

Code writted by Virginie Corneau

Program will:
-Take in a user input of rock, paper or scissors;
-Put it up against a randomly generated choice from the "opponent";
-Evaluate whether it's a win, loss or draw
-Keep score for 5 rounds and declare a winner.

Early iteration will display the results using console.log(). A GUI will be added later on in the process.
